Read more about the journey in Reid Hoffman's words.\n\nOur product is an app-based solution that lets immigrants send money back home to emerging markets instantly and at very low prices. Since launching in summer 2018, we've already moved tens of millions of dollars and reached tens of thousands of customers. We're live in seven European countries, and we support payments into Senegal, Mali, Zambia, Guinea, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Kenya, Madagascar, DR Congo, Morocco, Vietnam and Bangladesh; with lots more countries launching soon.\n\nGlobal remittances account for over $500 billion annually, most of which moves back into developing countries.

We're helping... people to send that money instantly and securely at a fraction of the cost.\n\nOur team is based across London, New York, Paris and Brussels, and we pride ourselves on hiring exceptional talent -- our team members come from a wide variety of top-tier tech companies, professional services firms, and industry leaders, including Twitter, Yahoo, Amazon, Google, McKinsey, Bain & Co, KPMG, Cravath, and Vodafone.\n\nTo continue our rapid growth, we're looking to bring on people who are passionate about our mission and excited to work in a small start-up environment.

        "description": "About Narrativ\nNarrativ is a subscription technology platform for brands to acquire new customers through trust-based marketing. We built an ad-free alternative to the e-commerce growth marketing playbook by building the commerce and payments infrastructure for the creator economy.\nBrands know consumers are tired of being inundated with ads that only tell one side of the story - yet the marketing playbook hasn\u2019t evolved. Unlike search engine marketing or social marketing, trust-based marketing is honest and unbiased, balanced with both pros and cons, and comes from diverse voices that speak with integrity and specificity. Creators are at the center of consumer trust today.\nNarrativ\u2019s technology gives all brands and creators - not just the top 1% - the tools to win in the $50 billion creator economy by building trust with consumers, not selling ads. We\u2019ve been recognized as a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer and one of Fast Company World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies alongside... giants like Google, Microsoft, and Slack.\nDo you share our vision for decentralizing the institutions that control the Internet today? Come join our team.\nWhy you should work here:\nWe\u2019re growing fast, without constantly diluting your equity: Narrativ is growing 3-4X year over year (yep, you read that right). Hundreds of brands joined Narrativ\u2019s platform in the last year, from enterprises like Best Buy, Sephora, and Samsung, to rising brands like Yeti, Cariuma, and Peace Out Skincare.\nMassive TAM, unique approach: We\u2019re tackling the creator economy and e-commerce, a $50-150 billion market. Narrativ\u2019s unique approach is that we believe technology is not neutral \u2013 its values are encoded by its creators. We value integrity, specificity, and diversity (not just scale at all costs).\nJoin a strong, diverse team: We\u2019re more than doubling in size and growing to a team of 130 by the end of the year. Narrativ is committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion \u2013 more than 50% of our leadership team are women. We\u2019ve taken the 15% pledge both in our talent strategy and across creators on our platform. We\u2019re amplifying our diverse team\u2019s support of communities of color by matching 200% of all individual donations as a company.\nLast, but very important, we are a startup: We\u2019re looking for people who aren\u2019t afraid to wield the chaos that comes with true creation, explore ambiguity, set the bar for excellence, and have full ownership over their impact. You\u2019ll never be a cog in a machine here, but you won\u2019t have the established blueprints of being one either. If all this sounds exciting to you, come join us.\n\nOverall\nNarrativ is looking for a Senior UX Designer to help usher our products into their next phase. This role reports to the head of product.\nYour outcomes in the first 1-2 years\nYou have helped craft the vision of what our client-facing products you will be transforming the complex into simple; raw data into usable insights.\nYou have helped us reimagine how our users do their work: from marketers at the hottest brands and retailers; to writers, editors, and creators who write the internet\u2019s most trusted recommendations.\nYou have externalized our internal tools into the self-serve platform necessary to scale and grow the company.\nAbout You\nTrack record of success: Has built an end-to-end experience that people currently use.\nStructured thinking and communication: Able to walk people through complex design decisions, both verbally and in writing.\nBackbone \/ building trust: Has a point of view, is willing to share it, has ability to persuade, is willing to disagree and commit.\nAdaptability: Has worked in a fast-paced environment \u2014 bringing well-worn frameworks to the table and the confidence to break from them when necessary.\nBaseline: 5+ years doing UX design. Comfort leading user interviews. Experience with at least one of these three things: (1) data\/dashboards or other dense, complex UX; (2) digital publishing workflows in news or magazines; (3) ecommerce marketing.\n\nImportant Notice: Narrativ will be going fully remote in 2021 and anticipate being a fully remote organization moving forward!\nNarrativ is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, or veteran status",
